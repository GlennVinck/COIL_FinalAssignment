      <h2>Our future dream city generated by AI</h2>
      <p>
        Using Krea AI and careful prompts, we have generated our future dream
        city. We emphasize the importance of abundant green spaces throughout
        the city and easy pedestrian access to most areas. We advocate for
        reduced automobile usage in the city and thus support advanced public
        transportation systems. Accessibility for individuals with disabilities
        is a priority for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ensuring the safety of all residents, especially children, is paramount.
        Furthermore, allocating space for children to play and relax is
        essential, which is why we have also created a vibrant playground.
        Education holds a central position in our vision; classrooms must be
        equipped with all necessary technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        As avid music enthusiasts, we believe street music would be a valuable
        addition. Our goal is to create a city where everyone feels welcome.
